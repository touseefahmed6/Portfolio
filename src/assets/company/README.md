## Missing Company Logos

The following company logo is missing:

- tesla.png - You'll need to add a Tesla logo image here. You can get one from:
  - Tesla's official brand resources
  - A reputable logo website with proper licensing
  - Create your own simple version

The logo should be:
- PNG format with transparent background
- Similar dimensions to other company logos (check meta.png, shopify.png, starbucks.png)
- Preferably black or dark color that will show well against the background

For now, I've created a placeholder file, but you should replace it with a proper logo image.

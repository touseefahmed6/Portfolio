## Missing 3D Model

The desktop PC 3D model (`scene.gltf`) is missing from this directory. You need to:

1. Get a 3D model of a desktop computer/PC setup
2. Export it in GLTF format
3. Place it in this directory as `scene.gltf`

Until you add the model, a placeholder purple cube will be shown instead.

You can find suitable 3D models from:
- Sketchfab (many free models available)
- TurboSquid
- CGTrader
- Or create your own using Blender or similar 3D modeling software

Make sure the model:
- Is in GLTF format
- Has appropriate licensing for your use
- Is optimized for web (not too high poly count)
